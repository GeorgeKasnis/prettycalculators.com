            <template v-slot:example>
                <p><b>1.</b> Calculating a 15% discount on an item priced at $80:</p>
                <p>Discount Amount = Original Price x Discount Percentage</p>
                <p>Discount Amount = $80 x 0.15 = $12</p>
                <p>So, a 15% discount on an $80 item amounts to $12 saved.</p>
                <p><b>2.</b> Calculating a 7.5% tax on a purchase worth $500:</p>
                <p>Tax Amount = Purchase Price x Tax Percentage</p>
                <p>Tax Amount = $500 x 0.075 = $37.50</p>
                <p>Thus, a 7.5% tax on a $500 purchase equals $37.50.</p>
